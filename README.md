# MIPS-CPU-Architecture-Single-Cycle-Datapath-based
Design, synthesis and analysis of a simple MIPS compatible CPU with Memory Mapped I/O.

The desing was based on standart 32bits MIPS ISA and the instraction will be 32 bit wide 
The instractions will support R,I and J types ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94614385/202234572-59ee448c-9942-4f29-8d9a-f6d2496d8ee8.png)

We used VHDL code to create the design( Using Quartus and Modelsim) and used Assembly code to check it ( Using IAR)
